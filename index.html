        </h2>

        <p> Cakes are not just delicious treats; they are also a form of art, and their designs can range from simple and elegant to elaborate and intricate. Cake flavors come in various flavors, ranging from classic vanilla and chocolate to more exotic options like red velvet, carrot, or lemon. Combining different flavors within the layers or incorporating fillings can add depth and variety to the taste. The shape and size of cakes can be round, square, rectangular, or even sculpted into unique shapes. The cake size can vary based on the number of servings needed. Buttercream, fondant, ganache, and cream cheese frosting are popular choices for covering and decorating cakes.
            Each type of icing has its texture, taste, and suitability for different designs. Decorate cakes with various elements like edible flowers, fruits, chocolate shavings, or sprinkles. Fondant allows for intricate designs and can be shaped into various forms, such as flowers, ribbons, or even figurines.</p>
